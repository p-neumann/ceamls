  <h3>Optimizing Quantum Circuits for Fast Cryptanalyzing Pre-Quantum  Encryptions and Securing Post-Quantum Cryptographies</h3>
  <p>This  project promotes the progress of science in quantum computing algorithms and cryptologic  techniques in order to improve security of encrypted information, which will  have national security and defense applications. Currently, the commonly used  encryption algorithms such as RSA are considered &ldquo;unbreakable&rdquo; by modern  digital computers due to the complexity of computation that would be required.  However, this may change in the next decade or so in light of advances in quantum  science. Quantum mechanics has led to the discovery that considerable numbers  of states can be manipulated at the same time thus significantly reduce the  amount of time in processing. New quantum computers have shown the baseline of  &ldquo;quantum supremacy&rdquo; in solving problems that classical digital computers  practically cannot. Efficient quantum algorithms are key to enable computer  scientists to take full advantage of the next generation of practical quantum  computers to efficiently solve today&rsquo;s unsolvable problems. Advances in quantum  science in both breaking and securing the encryptions are paramount for  national security and preventing adversaries from taking advantage of critical  areas of national defense. This project seeks to discover efficient quantum  cryptologic methods (i.e. the art of revealing the secret) and secure quantum  cryptographic techniques (i.e. the science of making the secret more secure). This  project not only exhibits the excellence in scientific research, but also  supports diversity and inclusion goals for the benefit of society. </a></p>
<p>Quantum  cryptoanalysis plays an important role in finding vulnerabilities of existing crypto  systems. It can also become an effective tool in fighting adversaries in cyber  operations. Efficient quantum algorithms are indispensable to the utilization  of quantum computer resources to solve today&rsquo;s unsolvable problems.Â  It has the potential to break the current  crypto systems such as RSA with the advances of next-generation quantum  computers. Currently, most quantum cryptanalytic algorithms have limited capability  to factor multiple integers due to the fact that each Quantum Fourier Transform  (QFT), the speed machine to find out a <em>period</em> of a particular integer,  requires a unique quantum circuit. According to Shor&rsquo;s algorithm, once the  period is found, finding factors (crypto keys) becomes easy. To break the RSA  encryption, one needs to design a unique quantum circuit for each integer being  exploited. Since there are a large number of integers to exploit, the current one  integer-one circuit factor finding approach is not practically useful. This project  aims to discover techniques to automatically generate quantum circuits and factor  multiple integers at once. The research also explores how artificial  intelligence can assist in designing efficient quantum algorithms and test  those algorithms using quantum simulators and on real quantum computers. Computational-wise,  the project speeds up the cryptanalytic process by improving the order of  approximation significantly on top of a polynomial degree that the QFT has  saved from the unsolvable exponential degree. The findings from this research  will have significant impact on both quantum cryptology and quantum cryptography.  This research seeks to transform cryptanalytic study from theoretical to  practical, and improve the integrity of the next-generation Quantum Internet.</p>
